AVL Tree Visualizer 🌳

🚀 Live Demo: AVL Tree Made Simple

An interactive AVL Tree visualizer built with React, designed to help students and developers understand how AVL trees (self-balancing binary search trees) work in practice.
With this tool, you can insert, delete, and traverse nodes while watching the tree rebalance itself through rotations in real time.

✨ Features

🔹 Insert nodes into the AVL Tree.
🔹 Delete nodes and watch the tree rebalance automatically.
🔹 Tree Traversals:
      In-order
      Pre-order
      Post-order
      Level-order (Breadth-first)
🔹 Real-time visualization of rotations (LL, RR, LR, RL).
🔹 Easy to use, responsive, and deployed online.

⚡ Why This Project?

Understanding how AVL trees rebalance is often difficult when studied only theoretically.
This visualizer helps by:
Showing how rotations happen step by step.
Helping students learn different traversals interactively.
Acting as a real-time learning tool to see AVL balancing in action.
